The objective of this project is to evaluate the different possibilities 
that we have in Python to find out the most efficient way to remove duplicates 
and compare it with our own C duplicate removal function.


Note: 
For profiling memory consumption with the memory_profiler module, it is recommended to make a time.sleep() of a few seconds in the body of the functions to analyze, just for a better visualization of the result.
